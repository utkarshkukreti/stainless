/// ## Internal Code Guide
///
/// This crate is centered around two traits, Parse and Generate,
/// which define how to parse a struct from a Parser over Rust code
/// and how to generate Rust code from a struct respectively.
///
/// All the parsing and generation of code is done through these traits.
///
/// `describe` is responsible for expanding the `describe!` macro
/// as a whole, and delegates to the Parse and Generate implementations
/// for `DescribeState`, which holds all the information necessary to
/// generate the AST for an expanded `describe!`.
///
/// The Parse implementation of DescribeState delegates to the Parse
/// implementation of Test, defined in the test module, and Bench,
/// defined in the bench module. The Generate implementation does the
/// same.
///
/// Most of the code can be understood by just walking through the
/// implementations of Parse and Generate for all the types inside
/// this crate, which can be found in the parse and generate
/// modules respectively.
///
